# Spatial-Hurdle-models-Leukemia_armed_conflict
Background: Pediatric acute leukemia is a frequent childhood disease. A violent environment could cause chronic stress during gestation and activate oncogenes. Colombia is a country characterized by very high levels of poverty, and by being struck by a non-international armed conflict for more than 60 years.  We  model the incidence and mortality rates for leukemia (LR and LMR) using as predictors: the Colombian index of armed conflict (IICA), Unmet Basic Needs (UBN), percentage of health coverage, percentage of people living in rural areas (Per_Rur), and eigenvectors obtained based on MESF.

Methods: This paper combines Poisson-Hurdle models and Moran eigenvector spatial filtering to model count data with excess zeros, overdispersion and spatial correlation. In many cases, there are no observations available for the whole set of possible explanatory variables and Moran eigenvectors used as covariates, collect these unobserved spatial structures improving the ability of the model to describe the process.
Results: The risk of suffering from leukemia or dying from this disease is higher for children exposed to armed conflict and is lower for children in extreme poverty.  All variables show significant spatial autocorrelation and significant cross-correlation with the LR and LMR.

Conclusions: Armed conflict index and poverty are significantly statistically associated with the incidence and mortality rate of Leukemia in children. 

Impact: This methodology is used to determine the impact of perinatal exposure to collective violence and poverty, on the incidence and mortality rates due to leukemia for Colombian children born between 2002 to 2013.
